School Website

Beta 1.0

For best performance you will have to use it in **1366 X 768** because that's for what it was designed and other
resolutions can have a lot of bugs. It will be compatible with more resolutions in future versions.

This is a website made my KnownAsDon. **It has nothing to do with he's original
website project** that you can find in his
**[github](http://github.com/knownasdon)**. This is made for school purposes and
is free to use.
